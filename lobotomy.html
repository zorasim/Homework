                This article is about the operation that severs connections within the brain.

            A <strong>lobotomy</strong> (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language" target="_blank ">Greek</a> λοβός (lobos) 'lobe', and τομή (tomē) 'cut, slice') or <strong>leucotomy </strong>
            is a form of <br /> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery" target="_blank">neurosurgical treatment</a> for 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder" target="_blank">psychiatric disorder </a>
            or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder" target="_blank">neurological disorder</a> (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy" target="_blank">epilepsy</a>, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_in_childhood_and_adolescence" target="_blank">depression</a>) 
            that <br /> involves severing connections in the brain's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex" target="_blank">prefrontal cortex.</a> 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobotomy#cite_note-2" target="_blank"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
            The surgery causes most of the connections <br /> to and from the prefrontal cortex, the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location#Anterior_and_posterior" target="_blank">anterior</a> part of the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe" target="_blank">frontal lobes</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain" target="_blank">brain</a>, to be severed.

            <br />

            <br />In the past, this treatment was used for treating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder" target="_blank">psychiatric disorders</a> as a 
            mainstream procedure in some countries. <br /> The procedure was controversial from its initial use, in part due 
            to a lack of recognition of the severity and chronicity <br /> of severe and enduring psychiatric illnesses, so it was said to be an inappropriate treatment.

            <br />

            <br />The originator of the procedure, Portuguese neurologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/António_Egas_Moniz" target="_blank">António Egas Moniz</a>, 
            shared the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine" target="_blank">Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine</a> <br /> of 1949 for the 
            "discovery of the therapeutic value of leucotomy in certain psychoses",<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobotomy#cite_note-5" target="_blank"><sup>[n 1]</sup></a> 
            although the awarding of the prize has been subject to controversy.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobotomy#cite_note-FOOTNOTESutherland2004-6" target="_blank"><sup>[5]</sup></a>

            <br />

            <br />The use of the procedure increased dramatically from the early 1940s and into the 1950s; by 1951, almost 20,000 lobotomies had been performed in the United States <br /> and proportionally more 
            in the United Kingdom.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobotomy#cite_note-7" target="_blank"><sup>[6]</sup></a> A large number of patients were gay men.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobotomy#cite_note-gay_attitude-8" target="_blank"><sup>[7]</sup></a> More lobotomies were performed 
            on women than on men: a 1951 <br /> study found that nearly 60% of American lobotomy patients 
            were women, and limited data shows that 74% of lobotomies in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario" target="_blank">Ontario</a> from 1948 to 1952 were performed <br /> on female patients.

            From the 1950s onward, lobotomy began to be abandoned,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobotomy#cite_note-biopsych07-12" target="_blank"><sup>[11] </sup></a>
            first in the Soviet Union<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobotomy#cite_note-13" target="_blank"><sup>[12]</sup></a> and Europe.
